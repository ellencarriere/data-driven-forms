Data driven forms is a react library for rendering forms

Schema - main data structure is easy to use

Form state & validation are handled by FinalForm behind the scenes

main components:

- form renderer is exactly what you would expect - it renders forms -
- mapper - maps the provided functionality (through passed props) to react components - component mapper
- schema - basic data structure

- you also have a form template - allows you to set a basic template for all of your forms
